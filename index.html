<p>This guide is a distillation of the principles found in Mike Bland's <a href="http://goo.gl/eE8IUw">Unit Testing Perspectives</a> presentation, licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US">CC BY 4.0</a>, based on a high-level outline by Mike and Dr. Robert Read of 18F. It also contains content copied directly from several of <a href="https://mike-bland.com/">Mike's personal blog posts</a> as well as some of his posts on <a href="http://autotestcentral.com/">AutoTest Central</a>; both blogs are also licensed under CC BY 4.0.</p>

<p>This playbook is divided into four sections:</p>

<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/principles-practices-idioms/">Principles, Practices and Idioms</a></h2>

<p>Fundamental automated testing and design concepts that inform the craft of
writing automated tests and testable code.</p>

<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apis-and-legacy-systems/">APIs and Legacy Systems</a></h2>

<p>Technical impediments to the automated testing of existing systems and how
to overcome them.</p>

<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rapid-prototyping/">Rapid Prototyping</a></h2>

<p>When it's OK to get by without writing automated tests, and when it's time
to switch gears and add them.</p>

<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/education-and-advocacy/">Education and Advocacy</a></h2>

<p>Models and strategies for driving adoption of automated testing throughout a
development culture.</p>
